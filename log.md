### Day 1: march 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: made some utility classes for the space site, learned about some css selectors (*-*) and (*:where(:not(:first-child)))

**Thoughts**: i saw how some libraries like tailwind uses utility classes and i think it will make a big differnce on how i'll write code in this project, and watched 2 videos from osama elzero's javascript oop playlist
